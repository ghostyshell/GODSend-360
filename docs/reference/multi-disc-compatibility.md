## Content Install Path Format

When installing Disc 2 as **Content**:

```
{Drive}:\Content\0000000000000000\{TitleID}\00000002\
```

- `{TitleID}` is the 8-character hex TitleID of **Disc 1** (the main game)
- `00000002` is the standard subfolder code for secondary disc/DLC content
- The file(s) from the Disc 2 ISO are placed directly in this folder

Some Add-On Content Discs (used by many publishers, e.g. 2K Games for Borderlands GOTY) carry a generic placeholder Title ID `FFED2000` in their `default.xex`, with content stored under:
```
content\0000000000000000\FFED2000\00000002\
```
The server automatically resolves the correct parent Title ID by reading the STFS header (offset `0x0360`) of the first content package in that directory. The resolved Title ID is used as the install destination so Aurora/FSD correctly associates the DLC with the parent game. A game-name heuristic is used as a fallback if the package probe fails.

## Notes

- TitleIDs can be verified via [XboxUnity](http://xboxunity.net/), [XboxDB](https://xboxdb.altervista.org/), or by reading the default.xex
- When in doubt, try **Content** install first; it's the safer choice for multi-disc games where Disc 1 launches the game and Disc 2 is referenced as DLC
- After installing Disc 2 as Content, Aurora/FSD will find it automatically when Disc 1 is launched
- If a game has 3+ discs, Disc 2 and beyond typically all go to the same `00000002` folder
